* This configuration table contains entries that are modified at runtime
* by the driver. The EDK tools populate the table with default values for the
* vector table and the options flag. These default values can be, and are,
* overwritten at runtime by the driver.  This is a deviation from most drivers'
* configuration tables in that most are created statically by the tools and
* are never modified during runtime.  Most tables reflect only the hardware
* configuration of the device. This IOModule configuration table contains
* software information in addition to hardware configuration.  The IOModule
* configuration table should be considered an exception to the usage of the
* configuration table rather than the norm.
