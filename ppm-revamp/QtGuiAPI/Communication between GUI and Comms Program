The Comms Program will be a standalone program that will be handling communication between the FPGA and the PC.
The GUI will be separate, but will need to communicate with the COMMS program. This could happen through Pipes or Filestreams.

Pipes
	Pros:
		Faster than Filestreams, making for more seamless communication
	Cons:
		Requires a larger amount of setup than filestreams (establishing pipe connections is less intuitive and more code than filestreams)

Filestreams
	Pros:
		Requires very little setup on the GUI end (just read and write to files)
	Cons:
		Slower than Pipes--communication might seem a bit less instantaneous
