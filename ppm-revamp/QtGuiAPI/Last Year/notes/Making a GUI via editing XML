Making a box that displays register values will be difficult for students to do, so we want to make an API that will edit the XML of a Qt GUI to create these boxes on the fly

Widgets that go within the body of the window seem to go inside here:

	<widget class="QWidget" name="centralWidget">
	...
	</widget>

Widgets are created as follows:
	
	<widget class="CLASSNAME" name="UNIQUE_NAME">	#CLASSNAME: Specifies what type of widget is being made (e.g. QScrollArea)
													#UNIQUE_NAME: Used for purposes of naming this specific widget

		<property name="PROPERTY">					#This specifies the property of the widget that you wish to sepcify. Some properties apply to most/all widgets.
	    </property>									#Other properties apply to only a few or even just one specific type of widget.

	    <property name="PROPERTY">					#Widgets will often have multiple properties.
	    </property>
	</widget>
